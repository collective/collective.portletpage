  [keul]

- title field is not required anymore.

  [keul]

- changes the ``i18n:domain`` of the configure.zcml of the
  browser module to "plone" (this is not formally right but,
  again, is needed for really translate views name).

- expanded left or right column if one of the two is missing,
  filling all space available.
  [keul]

- the Plone 4 "Hide" portlet now works also there.
  [keul]
